# selenium-webscrapping
"https://www.holidify.com/country/india/places-to-visit.html". For scrapping this website  Selenium is used, a tool that automates web browsers, to open a Chrome browser window and navigate to the website. The website contains a list of popular tourist destinations in India, along with their ratings, best time to visit, and a brief description.

The code first creates a Service object with the path to the ChromeDriver executable, which is then passed as a parameter to the webdriver.Chrome() function to create an instance of the ChromeDriver. The get() method is then used to open the website in the browser.

The code then defines several empty lists (places, rating, best_time, description, w, x, y, xpath_list, xpath_li, xi, yi, and wi) that will be populated later with data extracted from the website. It then creates several XPath expressions that identify the HTML elements containing the desired data, and adds these expressions to xpath_list, xpath_li, and xpath_l.

The code then uses a for loop to iterate over a range of values and extract data from the website using the XPath expressions. The extracted data is appended to the appropriate lists.

Finally, the code clicks on a navigation link on the website to display additional tourist destinations and repeats the process of extracting data using the new XPath expressions, appending the results to the appropriate lists.

Overall, the code is scraping data from the website to create a list of popular tourist destinations in India along with their ratings, best time to visit, and descriptions
